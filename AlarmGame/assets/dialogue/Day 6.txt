//Day 6: Unstructured day with freedom

//OFFICE STILL with Sabrina sitting Howard standing.

//Howard
[   ["Hello, PLAYER.",
    "It seems like we got off on the wrong foot yesterday.",
    "Most people are right footed, but I am left footed. It is one of the many things that makes me unique.",
    "I came here to tell you that...",
    "And let it be known that I am contractually required to say this,",
    "I'm sorry if you maybe got offended by me being completely reasonable yesterday."]
    ["3QI'm sorry, okay?"]
    
    ["I don't sweat. I perspire."],
    ["-H2 You don't sound sincere. I can easily detect it in your tone"],
    ["+H3 Enemies, you say?",
    "What an interesting dynamic shift.",
    "You have not heard the last of me, rival!"]
    
    ["Now, farewell! I must return to business. I'm sure you understand",
    "Well, I'm sure you try to understand."] ]
    
//Howard leaves at this point
    
//Sabrina
[   ["Oh that's Howard for you. Did you get a chance to talk to him yesterday?"],
    ["3QDid he do anything fun on his vacation."],
    
    ["Oh, I'm sorry...",
    "He must of just been in a bad mood. I for one love talking to you!"],
    ["+S5 Oh wow! That's incredible!",
    "I haven't heard of anyone whose gone to Jupiter!",
    "I'll have to congratulate him later!"]
    ["-S3 Oh... well that's a little harsh don't you think?",
    "He's a little out there, but he's vital to business!"] ]
     
    
//Player responses
[   ["Don't sweat it, Howard.",
    "Sure, whatever."
    "I hate you. We are enemies now."],
    
    "He wasn't really interested in talking to me.",
    "Yeah! He went to Antarctica! And Jupiter!",
    "I don't care. I hate that guy so, so much."]

[   ["It's a sandwich. Somebody left it here.",
    "It looks alright, but you don't know how long it has been here for.",
    "Do you want to spend your time eating this sandwich?"]
    
    ["The sandwich tastes incredible!",
    "Each bite is more satisfying than the last!",
    "You ate the entire sandwich.",
    "Let's hope nobody comes looking for it."] ]

    ["No time. Need. Bathroom. Now."]

//Then when interacting with the bathroom

    "It must have been the sandwich that you ate yesterday."
