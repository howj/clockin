Day 11: Conflict introduced!

//OFFICE STILL with just you, and Leo's garbage

//Player's thoughts
[   ["Looks like Leo is late to work, and there's plenty of his leftover garbage from yesterday",
    "That guy is kind of a lost cause...",
    "So long as he doesn't get me fired, I don't mind too much.",
    "I should probably get to work",
    "What's this? An email from 'REDACTED'?"],
    
    [?2I probably shouldn't open it, but..."],
    
    ["Let's see, it reads: 'The company you are working for is not as it seems.",
    "BusinessCorp has been linked to several illicit financial schemes.",
    "We will be contacting you via this machine this afternoon.",
    "Do not miss us, or you will regret it. This is information you need to hear.'",
    "Whoa, I wonder what this could mean...",
    "I better make sure I'm on my computer this afternoon."],
    
    ["Probably better that I don't read that.",
    "It's probably just some scam, or an accident.",
    "Either way, I'm not too worried about it.",
    "Well, here goes another work day!"]    ]
    
//Player reactions
[   ["Open the email.",
    "Delete the email."]

//During the afternoon, player interacts with unknown person no matter what

//Player thoughts upon reaching Afternoon
"It's the afternoon. Let's see what that person has to say at your computer."

//upon interacting with computer
"A messaging program appears on your screen. You have never seen it before.",
"You can't close it. It looks like all you can do on your computer is type to respond."
//Name should read REDACTED

[   ["You showed up. Good."],




//if they didn't read the email
//Player thoughts upon reaching Afternoon
"Someone just texted you. The message is from 'REDACTED'",
"It reads: 'Go to your computer now. We need to speak to you.",
"What could this mean? You better go to your computer

//upon interacting with computer
"A messaging program appears on your screen. You have never seen it before.",
"You can't close it. It looks like all you can do on your computer is type to respond."
//Name should read REDACTED
//Should appear as a blurry silhouette or something

//this point below appears for both options
   
    ["?2Now pay attention to what I am about to say."],
    ["If I wanted you to know, then you would know."],
    ["Good."],
    
    ["You have been selected for a very important purpose.",
    "BusinessCorp is a fraudulent lie. Surely you have noticed."]
    
    ["?2What exactly is it that you do?"]
    ["Listen to yourself. What does that mean?",
    "You've been fed a stream of meaningless buzzwords."],
    ["Exactly. There doesn't exist any public record describing the nature of BusinessCorp's work.",
    "All that exists is thousands and thousands of files discussing 'business'"],
    
    ["?3Listen, for now we need you to lay low. Don't arouse suspicion."
    ["Good."],
    ["You don't have to. Just do what we say."],
    [".....",
    "No. No we are not.",
    "Don't read your boss's emails anymore.",
    "It's... too risky."]
    
    ["Do not arouse suspicion. And whatever you do...",
    "Don't get fired."],
   
    //Silhouette should disappear now
    ["Your computer has returned to normal. Their is no evidence of this person's interference.",
    "This is crazy... I better act normal and go home for now."
    
//Player responses
[   ["Who are you? What's going on?",
    "I'm listening."],
    
    ["Business.",
    "I don't know"],
    
    //This might be difficult, I want the third option to only display if the player interacted
    //with the laptop in the conference room.
    
    ["Okay, I will.",
    "I'm not sure I trust you.",
    "Are you extorting money from Roy? I read his emails."] ]
