//Day 13: Regular unstructured day

//OFFICE Still with Howard and Leo

//Howard
[   ["Well, I'm glad they put the two least experienced people here at the same desk.",
    "It's nice for the top deliverers to have you out of our way."],
    
    ["?2Or I should say, MY way."],
    ["-H5 Don't patronize me. I see through your words",
    "Don't think for a moment that you can trick me with flattery."],
    ["+H5 Actually, yes, yes I did.",
    "How observant of you. I am impressed."],
    
    ["Well, PLAYER, I hope that nothing distracts you from your work.",
    "Things are usually quite stable day to day here, so I anticipate that you will be fine.",
    "It would be a real surprise if something out of the ordinary were to happen.",
    "A real surprise indeed..."]
    
//Howard leaves

//Player responses
[   ["Oh Howard, you are so reliable!",
    "Did you just come here to brag and insult us?"] ]

//Leo
[   ["Is it just me or am I the only regular person at this office?",
    "At least Sabrina's pretty ordinary, but apart from her you've got...",
    "A egotistical psycho nerd,",
    "Two bickering freaks in the warehouse,",
    "And a fat old business clown."],
    
    ["?3Then there's you, and you are kind of..."]
    ["Sure, yeah, I guess."],
    ["Yeah, now that you mention it, you are kind of just a blank canvas,",
    "Almost like everything you say was someone else's decision,",
    "Hmm... weird."],
    ["What? What are you talking about?",
    "The work we do is boring as shit, no way you are a secret agent.",
    "What, you fight crime with staplers? Give people papercuts? Please."]
    
    ["Eh, whatever, time to pretend to work!"]  ]
    

//Player responses
[   ["Professional?",
    "Regular?",
    "Literally a secret agent. Like, I'm not kidding."]    ]
    
//Player now free to walk around
