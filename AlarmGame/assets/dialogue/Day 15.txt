//Day 15: Endings presented

//OFFICE STILL with just you

[   ["This is weird. It's just me. Where is everyone?",
    "I better log into my computer at the very least.",
    "What's this? A new email sent to all BusinessCorp employees,",
    "With the subject line 'BusinessCorp CEO Tax Returns 1995-2018'",
    "I better read this...",
    "'BusinessCorp CEO Roy Schmoy has been evading corporate taxes for over two decades now.'",
    "'His company has been linked to several money laundering schemes tied to international drug distribution rings.'",
    "'Rampant union code violations. Millions of dollars simply missing. Books cooked to a papery stew.'",
    "The email continues with ample evidence of BusinessCorp's illegal actions.",
    "I could lose my job. Oh my god. What am I going to do?"]   ]
    
//Sabrina appears

//Sabrina
[   ["Hey, PLAYER. Looks like this is the end of the road for us.",
    "Roy didn't even come in to work today, looks like this email's got him scared.",
    "There's no way BusinessCorp can recover from this if this information goes public.",
    "It looks like this email has only been sent to employees so far,"],
    
    ["?3 We need to make sure that the authorities find out about this."],
    ["I know I am. It's the right thing to do."],
    ["Well I am sure. I know that this is the right thing to do."],
    ["-S10 No, I am not crazy. Don't yell at me.",
    "I really don't think you are like the rest, PLAYER, you are a good person."],
    
    ["We need to make sure we don't get lumped in with Roy.",
    "The only way we can do that is to make help the authorities.",
    "Think about it, it's the only way we get out of this as the good guys.",
    "We better tell them soon, tomorrow even.",
    "If you don't, then I'll have to do this on my own.",
    "Think about it."]   ]
    
//Player responses
[   ["You might be right.",
    "I'm not sure that is a good idea.",
    "Hell no! Are you crazy?"]  ]

[   ["?2Greetings, comrade!"],

    ["Oh come on, you think anyone else here could have hacked your machine?"],
    ["+H5 Mmmmhmmmm, you better believe it!"],
    
    ["That's right, baby! It's me! I've done my homework and Roy is going down!",
    "It was easy, really, hacking your machine, finding Roy's trail of financial bread crumbs.",
    "I'm honestly surprised I didn't do things sooner, but I needed you on my side.",
    "You see, I need you to help me pull off my master plan!",
    "Roy won't listen to a word I say now, but he trusts you more than anyone else here.",
    "You have to help me rile him up, get him scared and agitated!",
    "Do it for me and we can extort that idiot for everything he is worth!",
    "We simply threaten to go public, make him believe it, then get him to wire all of his funds to us."],
    
    ["?3We delete all correspondence, and flee with the cash! What do you say?"]
    ["+H10 That's because it is so brilliant!",
    "We will do it together, and we will be rich til our dying days!"],
    ["-H5 Do you really doubt my capabilities after all I've demonstrated!?"],
    ["-H15 I see...",
    "I implore you to reconsider, but doubt you are capable of such mental clarity,",
    "You foolish, stupid woman."]
    
    ["I will strike tomorrow, with or without you. Good day!"]

//Player responses
[   ["What?",
    "It's you! Isn't it?"],
    
    ["It's incredibly tempting.",
    "Do you actually think we can get away with that?",
    "Screw you, Howard. You're a sick, sad little man."] ]
      
//Howard leaves

//Leo appears
[   ["Man, this business stuff is crazy. People are crazy...",
    "I mean, the stuff people will do for just some money. Like, who cares really?",
    "I just wanna make a sandcastle and eat spaghetti..."],
    
    ["?2Don't tell me you are getting wrappep up in all this?"],
    ["-L10 Shut up.",
    "This doesn't matter. Everyone keeps yapping on about business and money.",
    "No one stops to think about anything else!"],
    ["+L10 ...Me too.",
    "I didn't know you felt the same. This whole business thing is just stupid."],
    
    ["I wanna let you in on a secret. All that time I was on Reddit, I was actually doing something else.",
    "Well, I was on Reddit like half the time, but the other half of the time,",
    "I was looking through Howard's coding work, and, well, I'm actually pretty good.",
    "I figured out a way to wipe it all. A security flaw that I guess Howard didn't catch.",
    "Or maybe he kept it there on purpose...",
    "Either way, just the push of a button, and BusinessCorp basically stops existing.",
    "No employee records, no tax returns, nothing.",
    "We'd all keep the money we have and we could just... walk away."],
    
    ["?3Would you just walk away from this nonsense with me?"],
    ["Then just do it. It's that simple. Finally something is."],
    ["It's not too simple. It's the only thing that makes any sense in this mess."],
    ["-L10 Figures, you are just like everyone else."],
    
    ["I won't do it unless you want to as well.",
    "I can't rob you of your job, your whole professional record.",
    "I'm lazy as hell, but I'm not a bad person."
    "I'm leaving for the day, but find me tomorrow."]   ]
    
//Player responses
[   ["Leo, this is important.",
    "I feel numb. These people are crazy and I can't relate."],
    
    ["I want to.",
    "It seems too simple, I don't know.",
    "You're pathetic. Your answer to all of this is to do nothing!?"] ]
    
//Leo leaves


//Player's thoughts
[   ["Wow. I have a lot to think about tonight.",
    "No one else is here, so there is no point in staying today.",
    "Sabrina, Howard, and Leo all seem at odds with each other.",
    "It seems I can't side with more than one person.",
    "Maybe I don't have to side with anyone.",
    "Either way, it looks like tomorrow might be my last day at BusinessCorp ever."]    ]
    
//Player goes home, and the puzzle can probably be something reeeeally simple, or impossible to lose, as the game is almost over.
