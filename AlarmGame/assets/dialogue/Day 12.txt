/*For next release, we might want to consider not introducing the warehouse,
in which case this can just be a regular unstructured day.
But if we can make a new map, I think it would be cool*/

//Day 12: Introduction of Shaun and Paul

//OFFICE STILL with Roy and Leo

//Laptop should no longer be in the conference room, even if player didn’t interact with it

//Roy
[	[“Greetings, PLAYER! I hope your business hasn’t stopped businessing.”,
	“I personally haven’t felt richer—“,
	“I mean fuller with other people’s money—“,
	“I mean… better. I haven’t felt better. I haven’t felt BETTER.”],

	[“?3How have things been for you the past couple of days?”],
	[“+R5 Hooray! You are quite the professional!”],
	[“-R3 Come on now, where’s your positive attitude?”],
	[“Uhhhhh....”,
	“Hahahaha! Funny joke! You are quite the comedian!”,
	“That’s... um… impossible though.”],

	[“Say, we received a new business shipment in the warehouse downstairs this morning.”,
	“Would you be able to take the elevator down to the warehouse right now?”,
	“The warehouse workers, Shaun and Paul, should have some business papers.”],
	
	[“?2Would you deliver them to the conference room for me?]
	[“+R3 Excellent! Your can do attitude fills my bank account.”
	“I mean— uh… my heart. Fills my heart.”],
	[“-R5 Excuuuse me!? Your job is whatever I determine it is.”,
	“And this is a business concern! You should feel honored I selected you.”]

	[“I expect those papers in the conference room promptly.”,
	“Good day now!”]	]

//Player responses
[	[“Full of business!”,
	“Pretty average. Not much going on.”,
	“The strangest thing happened yesterday. My computer was hacked.”],

	[“Sure!”,
	“That isn’t part of my job.”]	]

//Roy disappears

//Leo
[	[“Man… Why does my dad hang out with that dude?”,
	“Maybe he pays my dad too, like, to be his friend?”,
	“Only way you could get me to hang out with him”]	]


//player can now walk around
//If they try to interact with anything other than the elevator, they see
“I should head to the elevator and down to the warehouse.”

//when they get to the warehouse, if they interact with anything other than Shaun and Paul, they see
“I should go talk to Shaun and Paul about those business papers.”

//Shaun and Paul interaction
//Shaun
[	[“Hi there! My name is Shaun!”]	]
//Paul
[	[“And MY name is Paul!”]	]
//Shaun
[	[“Would you SHUT UP!? I’m talking here!”]	]
//Paul
[	[“HEY! YOU shut up! I’M talking here!”]	]
//Shaun
[	[“No, YOU shut up!”]	]
//Paul
[	[“No, YOU!!!”,
	“……….”],
	[“?2Anyway, what did you want?”],
	[“Oh, okay. I’ll get them right away.”]
	[“-P5 I am not an idiot, but Shaun definitely is!”,
	“Anyway, let me get you those papers”] 	]
//Shaun
[	[“No, I’LL get them!” ME!”,
	“You screw EVERYTHING up Paul!”,
	“He’d probably come back with a fish!”]	]
//Paul
[	[“That’s stupid!”]	]
//Shaun
[	[“YOU’RE stupid!”,
	“Anyway, here are the papers. Take them!”,
	“Now get out, I need to kick Paul’s ass!”]	]
//Paul
[	[“Ohhhh, I’d like to see you try! Get over here!!!”]	]

//Player responses
[	[“Roy asked me to grab the new business papers from you”,
	“Give me the business papers and shut up you idiots.”] ]

//Player thoughts
“Well that was weird… Better get these papers to the conference room”

//Then player must interact with the conference table (new interactable), if they do anything else, they see
“I better get these papers to the conference room”

//at this point, time progresses and the player is free to walk around.
