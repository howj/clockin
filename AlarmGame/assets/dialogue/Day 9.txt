//Day 9: Leo brings his dog

//OFFICE STILL with Leo and Roy

//Roy
[	["Good morning PLAYER. I hope things have been going well with Leo here.”,
	“His dad and I are old golf buddies! We go waaay back!”,
	“Due to this tangential connection, I am confident that this person I have never met will make an excellent employee.”],

	[“?2How has Leo been so far?”],
	[“+R2 Great! I knew he would be. My keen business sense never fails!”],
	[“+R1 Oh! Hahahahaha! Excellent joke!”,
	“That is impossible. He is my friend’s son, therefore he is a good employee.”],

	[“On another note, I’ve detected something… strange in the office today.”,
	“I was walking from the elevator through the hall earlier and I could have sworn I could smell…”,
	“A dog.”,
	“As you know, BusinessCorp is a strict No Dog Business.”,
	“Doggy Business is the ONLY business that we simply do not tolerate!”,
	“Let’s hope it was just my imagination.”,
	“Well back to my napping chair.”,
	“I mean— sleeping office.”,
	“I mean….. business!”] ]

//Player responses
[	[“He’s been alright.”,
	“He is lazy and awful.”]

//Leo
[	[“Umm…”,
	“I… uhh…..”,
	“I have to….. go. To the….. closet. For…..”,
	“……….work and um, business!”] ]

//FREEDOM to walk around

/*New interactables
    Leo in the storage closet

//At this point Leo should be in the closet with something that looks like an obscured lump with a sheet over it.
//If anyone goes and tries to interact with the closet during the Morning or Lunchtime, they get the following prompt

//Leo
[	[“?2Don’t come in! I’m uhh… busy”],	
	[“Um… no. Uh, come back later please!”],
	[“”]	]

//Player responses
[	[“Leo, let me in.”,
	“Walk away from the closet.”]	]

//Then if a player interacts with the closet during the Afternoon

//Leo
[	[“?2Don’t come in! I’m uhh… busy”],	
	[“Uh… Okay. Let me open the door],
	[“”]	]

//Then the player can walk in and interact with Leo
[	[“So, uh… PLAYER… This is Rufus.”]		]

//The sheet lump image should now turn into a dog image.

[	[“I know that dogs aren’t allowed here at BusinessCorp, but he’s just so freakin’ cute!”,
	“Look at him! Look at his little ears and face!”
	“He cried all day long when he was home alone without me yesterday. There were puddles of tears!”
	“He chewed through my couch. THROUGH it! There is a whole in the MIDDLE of my couch all the way through!”,
	“Please, he gets so stressed without me, but look at how happy he is here! Look at that smile!”,
	“Wait, is that someone outside the door?”,
	“Oh no, I think it’s Roy. Please go talk to him. Please don’t tell him about Rufus!”,
	“If you help me hide Rufus, you can come in and pat him every single day if you like!”]	]

//Now the player must go outside the office and interact with Roy, I think he can easily block the path so that the player
//Can’t go anywhere else in the office.

//If the player tries to interact with Leo now, they will be prompted with
“Please, please go and talk to Roy. Don’t tell him about Rufus.”

//Roy interaction
[	[“I smell dog.”,
	“The scent is unmistakably canine!”],
	
    [“?2I heard you talking to Leo in there, what is going on?”]
	[“A BUSINESS OUTAGE!? What a calamity! I love business!”,
	“I’ll go investigate right away!”],
	[“+R20 Thank you for your honesty.”,
	“I’ll have that dog removed from this office at once.”,
	“But first, I need to go fill out the Dog Removal K-9 form in my office.”,
	“Good day.”]	]

//Player responses
[	[“I heard there is a business outage in the basement. You better check it out!”,
	“Leo’s dog is in the storage closet”]	]

//Then, the player interacts with Leo one last time

//If they got Roy to leave
[	[“+L15 You are my hero! Rufus’s too!”,
	“Oh, PLAYER, we can’t thank you enough! Seriously!”,
	“I’ll keep Rufus in here during the work days. Please come in and give him some pats whenever you want!”]	]
//Player’s thoughts afterwards
“Well that was eventful. I guess I’ve got a dog friend at work now. I’d better head home for the day.”


//If they sold out the pooch
[	[“-L20 I can’t believe you, man. You are the worst.”,
	“Get away from me. Don’t you so much as look at Rufus!”,
	“I really thought you had my back. Now Rufus will be alone every single day and it’s your fault!”] ]
//Player’s thoughts afterwards
“Well that was eventful. I guess Leo is super pissed with me now, but Roy seemed pleased. I’d better head home for the day.”

//If a player tries to interact with anything else during the Afternoon
“I should really go see what is up with Leo in the storage closet.”
